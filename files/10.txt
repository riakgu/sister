I just saw a picture of a finger cut open, and quite frankly that is one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen. I am not really sure if I like my nail polish color, it is a cool color, but I am not entirely sure that it looks good on me. Rosie just mentioned dogs which makes me think of my dog, Cleopatra, who I miss very much. She is a black cocker spaniel with white patches on her stomach and, she has beautiful big brown eyes. She is one of the cutest things I have ever seen. She waits for my little brother to come home from school at the window next to our front door. Oh yah I want to download Dr. Dre's new song, but for some reason I cannot remember the name of the song. And I can't get Napster, because of this stupid UT network, so I have to use Imesh, which is not as good as Napster, because I can't just write in the name of a song. I have had quite a bit of computer trouble lately.
