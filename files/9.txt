O just go to the store and buy any shampoo that I want but not her she buys the most expensive thing at the mall, we are so different, yet so alike. Maybe I just like to put on the image that I don't care when I really do, while she cares and she admits it. Right now I feel like turning on the tv so that I don't fall asleep while I am typing this assignment up. I always get sleepy around this time but I feel so guilty taking a nap because I have so much work that I should be doing. Right now I hear Rosie O'Donnell in the background and they are talking about NYC and now I want to go hang out in New York with my friends and I also want to go each some chocolate chip cookies. I am the biggest chocoholic. But my dad has diabetes, so I have decided that I would start to be cautious about what I ate. Right now I am trying to keep up with everything I am thinking but my fingers cannot move as fast as all my thoughts.
