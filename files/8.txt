I am not exactly sure how this is supposed to work, but I will give it a try. I am wondering if I am thirsty because I see the Aquafina bottle on my desk. I know I will jump to a random thought soon. I just have not figured out exactly what it is. I am thinking about going to my next class at 5:00 for the Cal discussing, and I am wondering if there will be any good looking guys coming today. There are a few cute ones, but who knows why they won't say hello. I myself don't think that I am totally unattractive, and on occasion I have been known to look hot. Now one of my friends would think that she was cuter and had a better body than me, but I do not think so. So anyhow that makes me think of how we went bowling the other day and that she did look like she had lost some weight because her pants looked good on her. She also has great hair, that never looks clumpy, how does she manage that?
