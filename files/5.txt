So, I called them. This is really going to help out my typing I can tell it's getting faster. It's 9:46 now. I think when I get through with this I'm going to go to my other friends from Pearland's room and watch a movie or something. It's so easy to not mean new people when you already have friends. There's about 25 people from my home town here. I've met new people in my classes and everything, but these are the people I spend all of my time with. We'll see what happens in the future. Before I left Pearland I had been dating a guy who's going to Sam Houston. We weren't that serious, but now I miss him a lot. We were talking about what we were going to do and I had just assumed we would break up because we would be far away but he didn't see it like that. He had like a list of reasons we should or shouldn't stay together. At any rate, I told him I had to experience new things in college, blah, blah, blah, and we basically decided to break up.
